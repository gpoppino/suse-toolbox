# Scripts to simplify running some SUSE related commands

The idea behind this repository is to store many scripts that simplify
performing some tasks on SUSE Linux products.

For example, mirror a repository by name in an SMT server with a single command,
instead of mirroring every repository enabled or read all the patches
information with a single command.
